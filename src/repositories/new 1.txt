today, the topic of my presentation is 
Understanding the Relationship between IoT and AI to Stop the Misconduct of 
Conserving Electrical Energy

Here, the problem we are trying to solve is the misuse of electric energy.
Before diving deeper,
lets look at the tech we will to need.
We will be using iot and ai. and some different kinds of sensors also
Now let's look at a way to save electricity that we are calling 
smart home concept.

so what is this shart home concept?
here, we can control devices remotely
monitor them remotely,
and most importantly devices can make desicions by it self. 
which makes them automatic
